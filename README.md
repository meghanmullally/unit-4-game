# Crystal Collecting Game 

This is a basic game where the user tries to match the computers generated random number. 

## How to Play 

the user is given a random number once they click the play button. The user will click on the 4 different crystals to try and match the random number. If the value of the crystals goes over the random number they lose but if your points match you win! The values of the crystals change every game. 

## Built With

## Challenges 

I had some difficutly getting the number values to add up together then placed on the page. Also making sure all my variables matched the HTML ids or classes. I did enjoy creating the css and html layout though!
